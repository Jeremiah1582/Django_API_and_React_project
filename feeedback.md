Great work team, In the last 2 weeks you have built an amazing functional project. There is still some distance until you reach the finish line, so you shouldn't stop challenging yourselves yet. 
This is an impressive achievement in the time given. 

# What do you still need to do to make sure your project qualifies as a DCI final project? 

- Deployment - To fully qualify as a final project you just need to have your project deployed and accessible online for the presentation.

- Presentation - you need to have a structured presentation. It can be on any media of your choosing. remember you only have 15mins in total to present what you have.
the presentation should clearly outline the concept of your project. A really good presentation would also highlight your challenges and your solutions to those challenges. 

# How can you make your project more impressive for employers in the future? 
The fact that you worked as a team to build this project, and collaborating through github, is already impressive. Other than looking at how well-structured, readable, DRY and practical your code is, employers are also interested in how well-documented your code is. I haven't seen your source code but make sure it is well documented as you progress in your project, and obviously ensure all your implemented features are working as expected. 

# How can you make your project more appealing to your end users? 
- The only way to know for sure is through getting it out there and doing market research. Then turning that data into features in your project(similar to what you did at the start with the questionnaire -- I see you progress bar ðŸ˜Š).
Aim to make the app as user-friendly as possible. 
Also, as Wisam mention, applying gamification features to increase and maintain app engagement is a plus.

- Areas of further improvement: 

        - Mobile friendly UI - using Flexbox CSS and setting a fixed-width or min-width on the cards
        
        - Implementing images for each workout and making the Countdown numbers bigger.

        - And since we are talking about rewards, why not throw around some digital confetti each time the progress bar moves ðŸŽ‰

        - OAuth -  as Christian mentioned, you plan to implement OAuth. This would look good to all stakeholders. 


Great Job Team, keep up the good work!
